# FairLens CreditAI

Data bias poses a substantial threat to the accurate prediction of credit card default payments, influencing the efficacy, fairness, and transparency of machine learning (ML) models. Numerous existing solutions that anticipate defaulters incorporate variables such as age and gender in their feature set, introducing inherent bias to the data. This bias can compromise the precision and generalizability of ML models, potentially leading to oversight of genuine patterns and relationships in the data or excessive tailoring to specific characteristics present in the training
data.

The initiative to develop a machine learning model for forecasting credit card default risks, with a specific emphasis on integrating AI ethics—particularly focusing on fairness, transparency, and privacy—constitutes a noteworthy advancement in the responsible deployment of artificial intelligence within the financial sector. The core objectives of this project are centered on leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of credit risk predictions. Concurrently, there is a deliberate commitment to prioritizing ethical considerations, addressing potential biases, ensuring transparency in the decision-making process of the model, and upholding stringent measures to safeguard user privacy.

## Dataset Information
Utilizing the "Default of Credit Card Clients" dataset from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository, this project explores predictive modeling in financial
behavior while emphasizing ethical AI practices
